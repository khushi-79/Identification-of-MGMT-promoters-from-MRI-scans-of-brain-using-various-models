# Identification of MGMT Promoters from MRI Scans of Brain Using Comparative Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI and ML-driven tool for brain tumor identification, achieving a 95% accuracy rate and significantly improving patient outcomes. The tool aims to identify MGMT promoters from MRI scans, which is crucial for determining the methylation status of tumors and guiding further chemotherapy decisions.

## Steps

1. **Dataset Collection:**
   - Initial dataset sourced from the [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification).
   - The dataset was transformed and finalized to a shorter, more manageable form, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushihpandya/reduced-mri-scans-data).

2. **Model Development:**
   - Six different models from Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) were trained and tested on the dataset:
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Logistic Regression (LR)
     - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
     - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
     - ResNet
     - Random Forest
     - VGG19

3. **Results:**
   - The highest accuracy achieved was 95% using the ResNet model.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Writing a research paper based on the findings.
   - Performing classification to determine the methylation status of MGMT promoters, aiding doctors in making informed decisions about further chemotherapy for patients based on MRI scans.

## Impact

The developed tool has the potential to bridge the healthcare gap by providing a reliable and accurate method for brain tumor identification, ultimately improving patient outcomes. It allows for quicker and more accurate decisions regarding chemotherapy, based on the methylation status of MGMT promoters observed in MRI scans.
